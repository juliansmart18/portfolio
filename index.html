  <h2>Hello, my name is Julian Smart.</h2>

  <p>As a classically trained musician, I am interested in:</p>
  <ul>

    <li>Designing tools to help support artists</li>
    <li>Similarities between music and code!</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>In addition to being a developer, I am a classically trained violinist and violist. After graduating from university, I was lucky enough to have a busy freelancing lifestyle. I played in orchestras, all kinds of private events, and even in a touring group that traveled across the country. I became interested in coding through the tools that I began using as a freelancer such as an iPad app that stores digital music scores, and even an app specifically used to manage tours! I hope to one day create useful tools to support freelancers.</p>
   <p>As a musician, I have interpersonal skills that have been developed through countless hours of collaboration with other artists and developing rapport with clients. I thrive when I work in a team, and am I am excited to be entering a field with so much possibility for collaboration and opportunities to learn from others.</p>
